description: >-
  The TB67H420FTG is a brushed DC motor driver that has a dual H-Bridge motor
  driver built in, along with over current protection (and notification).

  With the ability to drive up to `50V` at `9A`, it's a very powerful driver. It
  can also be put into single H-Bridge mode in which two motors are driven in
  sync, or one motor is driven with both outputs, allowing twice the power.

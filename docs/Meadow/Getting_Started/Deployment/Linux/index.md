# Deploy a Meadow Test App

To verify that your Meadow OS is installed correctly and everything is setup, you should deploy a known working test app. We've provided an app that controls Meadow's onboard RGB led.

The steps in this guide have been tested on Ubunutu 18.x and should work on any current version of Ubunutu or Debian.

To deploy an app to Meadow you'll need several things:


1. A copy of [mscorlib.dll](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/binaries/mscorlib.dll).
1. A copy of [System.Core.dll](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/binaries/System.Core.dll).
1. A .NET 4.7.2 console application that references the Meadow NuGet package. To validate your setup, you can download the provided sample [app](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/HelloMeadow.zip).

## Setup

1. Follow the steps in the [Setup](/Meadow/Getting_Started/Setup/) .
1. Open the terminal.


## Prepare your app for deployment
1. Copy the **app files** into into the **/tmp** root folder on your Linux PC. We've provided sample binaries for you to deploy.
 * [Sample App](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/HelloMeadow.zip)
2. Copy the provided **[mscorlib.dll](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/binaries/mscorlib.dll)** and **[System.Core.dll](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/downloads?f=/Meadow_Beta/binaries/System.Core.dll)** into the **tmp** folder.

## Compile ST-Util
You'll need to download the source code and compile a customized version the software used to communicate the ST-Link V2 USB device.

### Setup
You'll need several packages, listed below, installed to compile ST-Util.
* libusb-1.0.0
* gdb-multiarch
* make
* cmake
* dfu-util
* git

Open the terminal and enter the following command to install the required packages at once:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0.0 gdb-multiarch make cmake installdfu-util git
```

### Compile ST-Link
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianstevens/stlink
git checkout semi
make release
```

## Connect Meadow to your PC
1. Follow this instructions to [connect your ST-Link V2 to Meadow](/Meadow/Getting_Started/Setup/stlink/).
* Insert your ST-Link V2 into a free USB port on your host PC.
* Open the terminal.
* Navigate to the folder where you compliled ST-Link.
* Start st-util using the following command - you should see **Listening at \*:4242...** (the **&** is used to run the script in the background).

```bash
.stlink/build/Release/src/gdbserver/st-util --semihosting -v -m 
```

## Start the application
1. Open a second terminal.
1. Enter `gdb` to start a gdb debug session (no debug symbols are currently available).
1. From the gdb prompt, enter `target remote :4242`.
1. Enter `c` to start the application.

The application may take several minutes to deploy. You'll see periods appear in the terminal indicating progress. Once the app is fully deployed, it will start running on Meadow. Any `Console.WriteLine` commands will appear in the terminal.

If you ran the provided sample app, you should see the RGB led changing color!

## Stop the application
1. Press control-C to stop debugging.
1. Enter `quit` to close gdb.
1. st-util will continue listening on port 4242 - you can now update the application in the tmp folder and restart gdp to deploy your updated app.

#### Install the Meadow Extension

You'll need to install the VS Tools for Meadow Extension by [downloading it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WildernessLabs.vsmeadow2022) or through the Extension Manager

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.
2. Click **Online** and search for `Meadow`.
3. Install **VS Tools for Meadow**, shut down all instances of Visual Studio, and restart.

### Step 2: Create a new Meadow Project

1. Open Visual Studio 2022.
2. Click **Create a new project**.
3. Search for `Meadow` (make sure to clear all filters).
4. Select **Meadow Application** and press **Next**.
5. Name your project `HelloMeadow` and choose project location.
6. Press **Create**.

### Step 3: Deploy your Application

The Meadow application template is a simple application that will pulse the onboard LED. As long as the [Meadow.OS is deployed to your Meadow board](/Meadow/Getting_Started/Deploying_Meadow), you can use the same techniques to deploy a Meadow application as you would any other .NET application:

1. Connect your Meadow device to your development machine
2. Right-click anywhere in the toolbar area and you'll see _Meadow Device List_ in the dropdown. Click on it and it will be added to your toolbar. (Alternatively, you can show the list from the **View** > **Toolbars** > **Meadow Device List** menu entry.)
3. Select the Meadow device COM port that correspond to your board in the Meadow Device List toolbar dropdown
4. Right-click project in Solution Explorer and choose **Deploy**.
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for your application to start

### Understanding the `Hello, World` App

Your "Hello, World" app should be running on your Meadow device.

[//]: # (Whenever editing these OS sections, make sure any common instructions are edited in the other OS/IDE sections as well to keep them in sync with each other.)

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Meadow Extension

#### Prerequisites

You'll need [Visual Studio 8.10.xx or 2022 for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

You can use any edition including Enterprise, Professional, or the free Community edition.

**Important**: Make sure to include the **.NET Multi-platform App UI development** component (or **Mobile Development with .NET** in older versions of Visual Studio) when installing Visual Studio.

![Screenshot of Visual Studio Installer showing the Mobile development with .NET payload selected under Desktop & Mobile install options.](Mobile.NET.png)

#### Install the Meadow Extension

You'll also need to install the Meadow IDE Extension for Visual Studio for Mac.

1. On the menu go to **Visual Studio** -> **Extensions**.
2. Click the **Gallery** tab.
3. Search for `Meadow`.
4. Select the **Meadow** IDE extension.
5. Click **Install...**

![Visual Studio for Mac Extension Manager showing the Meadow extension in the Gallery search results.](meadow_extension.png)

#### Known issue when updating the Meadow Extension on MacOS
Occasionally, when updating the extension, or if you install the extension manually from file, Visual Studio for Mac will end up with a corrupt extensions database and you may have more than 1 Meadow extension installed. The extension will not work correctly if this happens.

To fix this do the following:
1. Shut down Visual Studio for Mac.
2. Within Finder, go to `~/Library/Caches/VisualStudio/17.0/` for VS2022 (use <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>` to get a path entry both that you can paste this path into).
3. you should see a `addin-db-*` directory. Delete it.
4. Restart Visual Studio for Mac. It will then recreate the addin-db-* directory from scratch. VS will take a little longer to start-up.

### Step 2: Create a new Meadow Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new Project: **File** -> **New Solution..**.
3. In the **Meadow** section, select _Meadow Application_ and press **Next**.
4. Name your project `HelloMeadow` and choose project location.
5. Press **Create**.

### Step 3: Deploy your Application

The Meadow application template is a simple application that will pulse the onboard LED. As long as the [Meadow.OS is deployed to your Meadow board](/Meadow/Getting_Started/Deploying_Meadow), you can use the same techniques to deploy a Meadow application as you would any other .NET application:

1. Connect your Meadow device to your development machine
2. Press the **Play** button in Visual Studio to compile and deploy your application
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for your application to start

### Understanding the `Hello, World` App

Your "Hello, World" app should be running on your Meadow device.

[//]: # (Whenever editing these OS sections, make sure any common instructions are edited in the other OS sections as well to keep them in sync with each other.)

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Meadow Extension

#### Prerequisites

You'll need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Visual Studio Code is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux with several CPU architectures supported across those platforms.

#### Install the Meadow Extension

You'll also need to install the [Meadow extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WildernessLabs.meadow). This extension works across all supported platforms.

1. Switch to the Extensions icon in the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar on the left. (Alternatively, you can select the **View** > **Extensions** menu item.)
3. Search for `Meadow` in the **Extensions: Marketplace** search bar.
4. Select the [**Meadow** extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WildernessLabs.meadow).
5. Select **Install** from the Meadow extension details.

### Step 2: Create a new Meadow Project

To create new Meadow projects for development, debugging, and deploying in Visual Studio Code, you will create a project using the command line.

1. Open a command line terminal on your desired platform. You can also open Visual Studio Code and open the Terminal panel it offers.
1. Within the terminal, navigate to the desired location where you want to create the new Meadow project, such as `MeadowApp1`.
1. If you haven't previously, run the following `dotnet new install` command to install the available Meadow templates onto your system.

    ```bash
    dotnet new install WildernessLabs.Meadow.Template
    ```

1. Run `dotnet new Meadow` to create an initial Meadow "Hello, World" app.

    Alternatively, you can also directly specify the folder where your new project will be created by appending the `--output` parameter to your command.

    ```bash
    dotnet new Meadow --output MeadowApp1
    ```

### Step 3: Deploy your Application

1. Open your new Meadow app folder in Visual Studio Code.
1. Ensure your Meadow board is plugged in and up-to-date.
1. Choose **Run** > **Start Debugging**. (Your code will automatically be built first.)
1. From the list of debugging providers, choose `Meadow`.
1. If prompted, select the serial port for your Meadow board.
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for your application to start.

### Visual Studio Code troubleshooting

#### Change your target Meadow device

After selecting the device deployment target the first time, the selected serial port value will be used for future deployments. If you want to change which device is targeted for deployment, select the **Select Device** status item in the bottom status bar or run the **Meadow: Select Device** command. This will open the prompt to select a different connected Meadow device.

![Visual Studio Code status bar showing the Meadow device selection details.](vscode_device_target_status.png)

#### Specify a .NET Version

Depending on your system configuration and installed .NET versions. You may need to add a `global.json` file to your project's directory to tell it to use .NET 6.0:

```
"sdk": {
    "version": "6.0.101",
    "allowPrerelease": false,
    "rollForward": "latestMinor"
}
```

#### Maintain your debug configuration

Optionally, you can also create a `launch.json` file to keep your debug configuration, instead of always running it dynamically. Select the Debug icon from the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar on the left, and use the button to create a launch.json file. Choose `Meadow` again from the list, and the default launch settings will be created for you.

```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Deploy",
      "type": "meadow",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "meadow: Build"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding the `Hello, World` App

Your "Hello, World" app should be running on your Meadow device.

* [Continue below to the details of the "Hello, World" Meadow application you just created and deployed.](#hello-world)

## Understanding the `Hello, World` App<a name="hello-world"></a>

The Meadow app template has one file: `MeadowApp.cs`. Let's take a quick look at that file.

### MeadowApp.cs

Meadow will automatically scan for a class that implements `IApp` and launch it for you.

Let's take a brief look at the MeadowApp class:

```csharp
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Devices;
using Meadow.Foundation;
using Meadow.Foundation.Leds;
using Meadow.Peripherals.Leds;
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace HelloMeadow
{
    // Change F7FeatherV2 to F7FeatherV1 for V1.x boards
    public class MeadowApp : App<F7FeatherV2>
    {
        RgbPwmLed onboardLed;

        public override Task Initialize()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialize hardware...");

            onboardLed = new RgbPwmLed(device: Device,
                redPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedRed,
                greenPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedGreen,
                bluePwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedBlue,
                CommonType.CommonAnode);
            return base.Initialize();
        }

        public override Task Run()
        {
            CycleColors(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
            return base.Run();
        }

        void CycleColors(TimeSpan duration)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Cycle colors...");

            while (true)
            {
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Blue, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Cyan, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Green, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.GreenYellow, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Yellow, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Orange, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.OrangeRed, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Red, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.MediumVioletRed, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Purple, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Magenta, duration);
                ShowColorPulse(Color.Pink, duration);
            }
        }

        void ShowColorPulse(Color color, TimeSpan duration)
        {
            onboardLed.StartPulse(color, (duration / 2));
            Thread.Sleep(duration);
            onboardLed.Stop();
        }
    }
}
```

### Meadow Namespaces

Let's break down parts of this class into pieces. First, the Meadow namespaces:

```csharp
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Devices;
using Meadow.Foundation;
using Meadow.Foundation.Leds;
using Meadow.Peripherals.Leds;
```

These are the typical minimum set of namespaces in a Meadow app class and provide the following functionality:

* `Meadow` - The root namespace contains Meadow application and OS classes, enabling you to interact with the Meadow.OS.
* `Meadow.Devices` - Contains device-specific definitions for different Meadow boards, such as the F7 Feather V1 and V2 dev boards, or the F7v2 Core-Compute module.
* `Meadow.Foundation` - [Meadow.Foundation](/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation) is a set of open-source peripheral drivers and hardware control libraries that make hardware development with Meadow, plug-and-play.
* `Meadow.Foundation.Leds` - Provided with the Meadow.Foundation library. Used to simplify use of RGB LEDs in this sample.
* `Meadow.Peripherals.Leds` - Provided with the Meadow.Contracts library. Used to access LED type enumeration.

### MeadowApp Class Definition

Notice that the `HelloMeadow` application class inherits from `App`, and has one generic arguments, in this case `F7FeatherV2`:

```csharp
public class HelloMeadow : App<F7FeatherV2>
```

All Meadow applications should inherit from the [App](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow.App-2.html) base class. Under the hood, Meadow.OS will look for a class in your code inheriting from `IApp`, such as the `App` implementation, and launches the app automatically. It also provides hooks for getting notified during system events, such as the board being put to sleep.

`App` requires one parameter: the current device definition. This is passed in to provide a strongly-typed reference to the current device.

The device class defines properties and capabilities of the current device, such as the pins. While your app is running, your code can access the current device from the `Device` property on the [`Resolver`](/docs/api/Meadow.Contracts/Meadow.Resolver.html) class, allowing you to access them using autocomplete, via the specific device type:

```csharp
Device.Pins.OnboardLedRed
```

```csharp
public override Task Run()
{
    CycleColors(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
    return base.Run();
}
```

From your app, Meadow.OS will call the `Initialize()` method, described below, for any setup code. Meadow will then call the `Run()` method which calls the `CycleColors` method with a duration of 1000 milliseconds.

### Controlling the Onboard LED via Ports

Direct access to hardware Input/Output (IO) is generally available via _ports_ and _buses_. In this case, Meadow.Foundation is doing that work for us and we are accessing an `RgbPwmLed` from the pins we tell it to use. In this case, we use Meadow's on-board pulse-width modulated LED light with three sub-component LEDs that are red, green, and blue:

```csharp
RgbPwmLed onboardLed;
...

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Initialize hardware...");

    onboardLed = new RgbPwmLed(device: Device,
        redPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedRed,
        greenPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedGreen,
        bluePwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedBlue,
        CommonType.CommonAnode);

    return base.Initialize();
}
```

The `Initialize` call writes to the console for informational purposes, useful when debugging and watching your app start. Then RGB LED is then created from the device itself, using the named `Pins` connected to the on-board LED available on the particular device specified above in the `App` definition.

#### Digital Output

To pulse the color of the light emitted via the onboard LED, we can utilize the built in `StartPulse()` method of the `RgbPwmLed` class, this is done in the ShowColorPulse method, which takes a color and duration. All of this is tied together with the CycleColors call which will simply cycle through a variety of colors:

```csharp
void CycleColors(TimeSpan duration)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cycle colors...");

    while (true)
    {
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Blue, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Cyan, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Green, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.GreenYellow, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Yellow, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Orange, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.OrangeRed, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Red, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.MediumVioletRed, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Purple, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Magenta, duration);
        ShowColorPulse(Color.Pink, duration);
    }
}

void ShowColorPulse(Color color, TimeSpan duration)
{
    onboardLed.StartPulse(color, (duration / 2));
    Thread.Sleep(duration);
    onboardLed.Stop();
}
```

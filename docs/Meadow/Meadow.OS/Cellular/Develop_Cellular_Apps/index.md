After having properly setup your hardware, you just need to follow a few steps to enable cellular on your Meadow application.:

* Configure your cellular provider and connection.
* Configure the Meadow pins and network setting.
* Handle cell connection and start making network requests

## Step 1: Adding a cell.config.yaml file

Create a **cell.config.yaml** file, set the `Copy To Output` property to `Copy always` or `Copy if newer`, and fill out the values under the `Settings` section like APN, Module, and a additional optional pins to ensure a proper connection with your internet provider. Here's what a cell config file looks like with the required and optional fields:

```yaml
Settings:
    APN: YOUR-APN         # (required) Access Point Name
    Module: BG95M3        # (required) Module model (BG95M3 or M95)
    User: USER            # (optional) APN user
    Password: PASSWORD    # (optional) APN password
    Operator: 00000       # (optional) Carrier numeric operator code
    Mode: CATM1           # (optional) Network mode (CATM1, NBIOT or GSM)
    Interface: COM1       # (required) Serial interface (COM1 (default), COM4 or COM6)
    EnablePin: A3         # (required) Enable MCU pin to power the module on/off
                          # Default value is MCU Pin A3
                          #   IMPORTANT:
                          #   Ensure to use the MCU pin names,
                          #   not the Meadow pin names (seen on the board)
```

A few things to consider:

* **Ensure to use the MCU pin names** in the `EnablePin` field, not the Meadow pin names (seen on the board). Consult the pinout definition on your Meadow device datasheet for the correct MCU pin names.
* If the carrier numeric operator code (**Operator**) or the network mode is not specified (**Mode**), the module will attempt to automatically determine the optimal network based on the M2M sim card inserted and your location.
* **However, if you encounter any connectivity issues, we recommend to set both the operator code and operation mode to the `Operator` and `Mode` properties**. If you don't know this information, you can use the [**Cell Network Scanner**](../Troubleshooting/#scanning-cell-networks) method that will list nearby networks in the area.

## Step 2: Specify Network Interface and reserved pins

In the `meadow.config.yaml` file, you need to specify `DefaultInterface` to `Cell` and specify the RX/TX serial pins and an additional pin for Meadow to enable the cellular module.

### Configuring Meadow F7v2 Feather with BG95-M3 or M95

If you're using a [Meadow Feather V2](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Common_Files/Meadow_F7v2_Micro_Pinout.svg), you would connect the cellular module to `D00` and `D01`, which are the COM4 serial pins that, according to the [datasheet](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/Hardware/Wilderness_Labs_Meadow_F7v2_Datasheet.pdf), the MCU pin names are `PI9` and `PH13`, but in the config file we can ommit the `p` prefix. As for the enable pin, say if you connect it to the `D10` pin, the MCU pin name is `C7`. So the required values in the config files should look like this:

```yaml
# Device specific config
Device:
    # Name of the device
    Name: F7v2Feather

    # Corresponding MCU pin names for the reserved pins
    # (COMX_RX pin, COM_TX pin, ENABLE pin)
    ReservedPins: I9;H13;C7

# Network configuration
Network:
    #  Which interface should be used?
    DefaultInterface: Cell
```

And your `EnablePin` and `Interface` in the `cell.config.yaml` should be `C7` and `COM4`, respectively:

```yaml
Settings:
...
    Interface: COM4       # (required) Serial interface (COM1 (default), COM4 or COM6)
    EnablePin: C7         # (required) Enable MCU pin to power the module on/off
```

### Configuring Project Lab v3 with BG95-M3

In the case that you're using a Project Lab v3 with the BG95-M3, if you look at the [latest schematic](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.ProjectLab/blob/main/Hardware/v3.e/Schematic.pdf) and trace what pins on the Meadow Core Compute Module are connected to the microBUS 1 connector, you'll find that are connected to pins `PB15`, `PB14` and `PA3` for the Serial RX/TX and Enable pins, respectively:

```yaml
# Device specific config
Device:
    # Name of the device
    Name: ProjectLabV3

    # Corresponding MCU pin names for the reserved pins
    # (COMX_RX pin, COM_TX pin, ENABLE pin)
    ReservedPins: B15;B14;A3

# Network configuration
Network:
    #  Which interface should be used?
    DefaultInterface: Cell
```

And your `EnablePin` and `Interface` in the `cell.config.yaml` should be `A3` and `COM1`, respectively:

```yaml
Settings:
...
    Interface: COM1       # (required) Serial interface (COM1 (default), COM4 or COM6)
    EnablePin: A3         # (required) Enable MCU pin to power the module on/off
```

### Configuring Project Lab v3 with M95

In the case that you're using a Project Lab v3 with the M95, if you look at the [latest schematic](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.ProjectLab/blob/main/Hardware/v3.e/Schematic.pdf) and trace what pins on the Meadow Core Compute Module are connected to the microBUS 1 connector, you'll find that are connected to pins `PB15`, `PB14` and `PH10` for the Serial RX/TX and Enable pins respectively:

```yaml
# Device specific config
Device:
    # Name of the device
    Name: ProjectLabV3

    # Corresponding MCU pin names for the reserved pins
    # (COMX_RX pin, COM_TX pin, ENABLE pin)
    ReservedPins: B15;B14;H10

# Network configuration
Network:
    #  Which interface should be used?
    DefaultInterface: Cell
```

And your `EnablePin` and `Interface` in the `cell.config.yaml` should be `H10` and `COM1`, respectively:

```yaml
Settings:
...
    Interface: COM1        # (required) Serial interface (COM1 (default), COM4 or COM6)
    EnablePin: H10         # (required) Enable MCU pin to power the module on/off
```

## Step 3: Handling Cell connection using a Meadow application

To check if you established a connection, you can use the `meadow listen` CLI command, which should return a message like this:
`Connection established successfully! IP address '100.69.106.222'.`

You can also check the Cell connection status by accessing the `IsConnected` property present in the `ICellNetworkAdapter`, as in the following example:

```csharp
var cell = Device.NetworkAdapters.Primary<ICellNetworkAdapter>();

if (cell.IsConnected)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cell is connected!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cell isn't connected");
}
```

Therefore, you can use the `NetworkConnected` and `NetworkDisconnected` event handlers with Cell.

```csharp
var cell = Device.NetworkAdapters.Primary<ICellNetworkAdapter>();

cell.NetworkConnected += CellAdapter_NetworkConnected;
cell.NetworkDisconnected += CellAdapter_NetworkDisconnected;

void CellAdapter_NetworkConnected(INetworkAdapter networkAdapter, NetworkConnectionEventArgs e)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Cell network connected!");
}

void CellAdapter_NetworkDisconnected(INetworkAdapter networkAdapter)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Cell network disconnected!");
}
```

**That's all!** After that you should get connected. If you are having issues to connect using cellular, please take a look at the [Troubleshooting](../Troubleshooting/) section.

You can also take a look at the [Cellular Meadow Sample App](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Core.Samples/tree/main/Source/Network/Cell_Basics/MeadowApp.cs) to help you on your first steps with cell!

### Getting module IMEI

You can get the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) through the `Imei` property.

```csharp
var cell = Device.NetworkAdapters.Primary<ICellNetworkAdapter>();

cell.NetworkConnected += CellAdapter_NetworkConnected;

void CellAdapter_NetworkConnected(INetworkAdapter networkAdapter, INetworkAdapter networkAdapter)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Cell network connected!");

    ICellNetworkAdapter cellAdapter = networkAdapter as ICellNetworkAdapter;
    if (cellAdapter != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cell IMEI: " + cellAdapter.Imei);
    }
}
```

> **Note**: Before using this property, ensure a successful connection has been established.

### Getting Cell Signal Quality

You can get the Cell Signal Quality (CSQ), in dBm, obtained at the time of the connection through the `Csq` property, which is updated after any connection network event.

```csharp
var cell = Device.NetworkAdapters.Primary<ICellNetworkAdapter>();

cell.NetworkConnected += CellAdapter_NetworkConnected;

void CellAdapter_NetworkConnected(INetworkAdapter networkAdapter, INetworkAdapter networkAdapter)
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Cell network connected!");

    ICellNetworkAdapter cellAdapter = networkAdapter as ICellNetworkAdapter;
    if (cellAdapter != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cell CSQ: " + cellAdapter.Csq);
    }
}
```

To get the most up-to-date Cell Signal Quality (CSQ), you should use the `GetSignalQuality` method instead of relying on the `Csq` property. However, you'll be disconnected from the cellular network for a brief period while the module gets the current signal quality, so it's advised to avoid calling this method frequently to ensure a seamless user experience.

```csharp
var cell = Device.NetworkAdapters.Primary<ICellNetworkAdapter>();

double csq  = cell.GetSignalQuality();
Console.WriteLine("Cell Signal Quality: " + csq);
```

> **Note**: Both the `Csq` property and the `GetSignalQuality` method return a value in dBm representing the Cellular Signal Quality (CSQ), while `-9999` indicates no connection.

The Meadow Command-Line-Interface (Meadow.CLI) provides a way to interact with the board and perform functions via a terminal window.

The Meadow.CLI tool supports device and file management including file transfers, and MCU reset.

To run Meadow.CLI on Windows, open a command window and run `Meadow.CLI.exe`. On macOS, call **mono Meadow.CLI.exe** to execute it via mono.

You can download the Meadow.CLI executable from the [downloads page](/Meadow/Getting_Started/Downloads/).

## Enumerating Options

To see the options, run the application with the `--help` arg. Some options exist that are of little or no use to the C# developer. This have not been include in the following list.

## Running Commands

File and device commands require you to specify the serial port. You can determine the serial port name in Windows by viewing the Device Manager, under the **Ports (COM & LPT)** node.

On Mac and Linux, the serial port will show up in the **/dev** folder, generally with the prefix **tty.usb**. You can likely find the serial port name by running the command:

```bash
ls /dev/tty.usb*
```

Note: The serial port can be specified with either `--Serial Port [NameOfSerialPort]` or simply `-s [NameOfSerialPort]`.

Note: Meadow.CLI automatically caches the serial port name. Once you've sent a command using the `--SerialPort` parameter, you can omit in future calls.

## Useful commands

### File transfers

Writes a file into the Meadow's flash file system.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --WriteFile file[,file,...] [targetFileName[,targetFileName,...]] --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### List files in flash file system

Lists all the files in the flash file system.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --ListFiles --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### List files and CRC checksum in flash file system

The command lists the same files as `--ListFiles` but includes the CRC checksum. Because this command must separately read each file, this command takes longer to execute than `--ListFiles`

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --ListFilesAndCrcs --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### Delete a File

Deletes one file from the flash file system.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --DeleteFile --TargetFileName [nameOfFile] --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### Get Meadow's device information

Requests the Meadows device information and including Meadow.OS version.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --GetDeviceInfo --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### Renew file system

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --RenewFileSys --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

This command recreates the files system. After invalidating the current file system, this command restarts Meadow. Once restarted Meadow recreates a new, empty flash file system. This command makes the reformatting command `--EraseFlash` unnecessary, unless confidential information needs to be erased.

### Reformat the flash

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --EraseFlash --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

This operation takes just over 2 minutes to complete.  It is recommended that you leave your Meadow device connected to your computer for about 3-5 minutes following the execution of this command and then reset the board. The command completely erases the flash memory device and on restart, recreates the file system.

### Restart Meadow

This command causes Meadow to be restarted from the Meadow.CLI.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --ResetMeadow --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### Stop/start the installed application from running automatically

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --MonoDisable --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --MonoEnable --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

### Read the mono run state

Reports whether mono will run or not on restart.

```bash
Meadow.CLI.exe --MonoRunState --SerialPort [NameOfSerialPort]
```

## Running applications

You'll typically need at least the following six files installed to the Meadow flash to run a Meadow app:

1. System.dll
2. System.Core.dll
3. mscorlib.dll
4. Meadow.Core.dll
5. Meadow.Foundation.dll
6. App.exe (your app)

It's a good idea to disable mono first, copy the files, and then enable mono.

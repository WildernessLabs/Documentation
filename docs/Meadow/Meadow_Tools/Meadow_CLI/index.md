![Meadow.CLI command-line interface running in a terminal window.](wildernesslabs_meadow_cli_getting_started.jpg)

The Meadow Command-Line-Interface (`Meadow.CLI`) provides a way to interact with the board and perform functions via a terminal/command-line window.

The Meadow.CLI tool supports deployment workflows as well as device and file management including file transfers, and MCU reset.

In addition to being able to be used from a terminal window, the `Meadow.CLI.Core` library can also be used programmatically, within a .NET application. In fact, the IDE extensions use that directly. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/wildernesslabs/Meadow.CLI).

## Executing Commands

Once installed, Meadow.CLI is accessible from a terminal prompt via the `meadow` command, and command arguments are passed via a fluent syntax, for instance, the following command will download the latest Meadow.OS:

```console
meadow firmware download
```

## Enumerating Commands & Help

This guide covers a few of the most common commands, but there are many more to explore. For a complete list of commands, execute the following from a terminal window:

```console
meadow --help
```

Additionally, you can get additional help information for any given command by passing `--help` (or `-h` shortened) as an option to that command. For instance, the following will provide guidance on the `listen` command:

```console
meadow listen --help
```

## Working with Ports

When a Meadow device is hooked up to a host computer, it communicates via a serial port (e.g. `COM3` on Windows or `UART3` on macOS/Linux) over USB. If you only have one Meadow device plugged in, Meadow.CLI will attempt to locate the port and send commands via that. However, if you have multiple devices, you may need to manually specify the port.

To list serial ports, execute the following:

```console
meadow port list
```

You can then specify which port to use with either the `meadow port select` command 

```console
meadow port select
```

or the `meadow config route` command. , replacing `{port}` with the port you found above.

```console
meadow config route {port}
```

You only need to configure the desired port once; all subsequent commands will remember the specified port.

## Common Tasks

### Download the Latest Meadow.OS and Flash to the Device

To download the latest Meadow.OS, execute the following:

```console
meadow firmware download
```

Once it's downloaded, it can be deployed to the device by placing Meadow in bootloaders mode and executing the following:

```console
meadow firmware write
```

### Build a Meadow App

To build a Meadow app, execute the following, replacing `{path}` with the path to the folder that contains your app csproj file.

```console
meadow app build {path}
```

### Trim a Meadow App

You'll typically want to trim a built Meadow app to reduce the app size when stored on your Meadow. To trim a Meadow app, connect your Meadow device and execute the following, replacing `{path}` with the path to the folder that contains your app csproj file.

```console
meadow app trim {path}
```

### Deploy a Meadow App

After your app is trimmed, you can deploy your app by executing the following, replacing `{path}` with the path to the folder that contains your app csproj file.

```console
meadow app deploy {path}
```

### Run a Meadow App

Once your app is deployed, run the following command to start the app by enabling the runtime on Meadow.

```console
meadow runtime enable
```

You can view console output from your running application by using the `listen` command.

```console
meadow runtime enable
```

There's also a convenience `run` command that will build, trim, deploy, run and start listening. Execute the following, replacing `{path}` with the path to the folder that contains your app csproj file. 

```console
meadow app run
```

### Working with Files

#### Listing Files on the Device

To get a list of all the files on the device, execute the following:

```console
meadow file list
```

#### Writing a File to the Device

To write a file, or files, to the device execute the following, replacing [Filename] with the full path of the file to write:

```console
meadow file write -f [Filename]
```

Multiple files can be specified with multiple `-f` parameters:

```console
meadow file write -f [Filename1] -f [Filename2]
```

#### Delete a File from the Device

Files can also be deleted:

```console
meadow file delete -f [Filename]
```

As with file uploading, multiple files can be specified with multiple `-f` parameters:

```console
meadow file delete -f [Filename1] -f [Filename2]
```

All of the files in the root of the file system can be deleted without reformatting the flash:

```console
meadow file delete all
```

### Get Meadow's device information

To get information about the device, including OS version, execute the following:

```console
meadow device info
```

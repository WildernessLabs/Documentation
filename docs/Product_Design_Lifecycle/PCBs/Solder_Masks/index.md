title: Solder Masks
---

Usually, the bottom and top of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) has a thin epoxy solder mask that covers the areas that components won't be soldered to

[protects the raw copper routes from oxidation and other]
[prevents solder bridging (accidental connections between routes when being reflowed]

[usually silkscreened on, with component solder placements masked so that they don't get covered in the finish]

[two types; glossy or matte, but available in a large number of colors]
[glossy or matte, process is same, usually cost is negligible, if any]

[matte is recommended]

 * [gloss can cause trouble for placement machines that use vision]
 * [gloss can also cause [solder balling](http://www.epectec.com/pcb/wave-soldering-defects/solder-balls.html)]

# Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Fundamentals

[Breadboards allow prototyping and developing. PCBs provide the necessary infrastructure to permanently hold electrical components together.]

## Anatomy of a PCB?
[maybe a cross section of a netduino?]

## Multilayer PCBs

[multilayer to provide crossing circuits across various planes. 2 layer is the minimum to allow crossing, but most modern PCB designs require more layers than that to provide efficient routing when many 

[because many components share power and ground, often times, the middle two layers consist of a ground plane layer, and a power layer, with the power plane being further subdivided (usually with 5v, 3.3v, and 1.8v being common component VCC voltages). sometimes, a layer with a heavier duty copper gauge will also be used for higher operating currents for things like motor control, etc.]

## Components

[historically, PCBs were populated with through-hole components; components that had legs that went through the board:]

[however, through-hole components have several disadvantages: ]

 * They require more real estate
 * They're more expensive to place
 * others

[so Surface Mount Technology (SMD) is now the gold-standard]

[Surface Mount Devices (SMD) are the components that replace through-hole devices by having flat feet or balls that sit on top of the PCB and solder directly to that layer, rather than going through all the layers.]

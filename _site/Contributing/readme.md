# Contributing

Wilderness Labs welcomes and encourages constrictive contributions. We believe that documentation is best when a diverse community of folks with a variety of perspectives and experience share their wisdom and findings with others. Additionally, documentation contributions are a great way to capture learnings that you may even reference yourself.

When contributing, please note that we have a strict policy on plagiarism; your contributions must be your own. Please do not copy and paste from external sources, unless they're your own writing that you are willing to contribute.

The documentation is all written in Markdown, and I (bryancostanich) highly recommend [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) as a markdown editor if you're on a Mac. 

### Typos and other Small Fixes

Typos and other small fixes, additions can just be made and submitted as a pull-request. No need to reserve the topic.

### General Documenation

For general documentation, please refer to the [Documentation Roadmap](/DocumentationRoadmap.md) to see a list of high priority requested docs, as well as writer reservations and other notes. 

### Samples

When contributing samples, please document them in a way that someone who is new to the concepts illustrated within can pick up the code and understand it. This includes both code-commenting, as well as a simple sample documentation page. 


### Pull Requests

All contributions should be submitted as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 


### [Style Guide](style_guide.md)

We've started a living style guide for docs.
